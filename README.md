# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-TimeSeries

Stock market, a very unpredictable sector of finance, involves a large number of investors, buyers and sellers. Stock prediction has been a phenomenon since machine learning was introduced. But very few techniques became useful for forecasting the stock market as it changes with the passage of time. As time is playing a crucial rule here, Time Series (TS) analysis can be used to predict short-term stock market. The first step for analyzing TS is to check whether historical stock market data is stationary using Plotting Rolling Statistics and Dickey-Fuller Test. Secondly, Trend and Seasonality is eliminated from the series to make the data a stationary series.
